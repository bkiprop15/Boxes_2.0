# description: aggregate all data rasters to specificed resolutions
#              then return a matrix of values for each resolution. In this
#              matrix, each row is a layer, each column a cell. Then for each 
#              cell, you will be able to return a numeric vector of values for 
#              each layer, which can be evaluated based on filter criteria
